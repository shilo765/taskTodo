My task is to develop a Todo List application, which will let the user perform CRUD operations over a to-do list.
in the frontend I used Kotlin,
The UI is clean and user-friendly.
In the backend I used NODE.JS

To run the application, replace the main folder in the Android project with Kotlin.
In addition, MYSQL must be installed and APP.JS must be modified according to the variables that are appropriate on your computer.
Of course, you need to change the connection data to the server in Frontend if it is not the default
The server must be run first and only then the application
